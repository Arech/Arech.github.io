# Themes

Supported themes https://pages.github.com/themes/

https://github.com/jekyll/minima - default, ok, but needs to change a code bg color
Current v docs are at https://github.com/jekyll/minima/tree/v2.5.1

https://pages-themes.github.io/midnight/ - nice, needs linenumbers for the code
Also as all other themes, need some layout fixes, such as https://github.com/studio84pottery/studio84pottery.github.io
In the essence, one should port all themes but the minima to the minima features and conventions

https://pages-themes.github.io/slate/ 
https://pages-themes.github.io/tactile/
https://pages-themes.github.io/hacker/
not bad, but all needs some fixing
